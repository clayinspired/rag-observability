# RAG with Real-time Observability & Monitoring

## Project Goal
Demonstrate production-level observability in a RAG system 
that can automatically detect failures at each pipeline stage.

## What Gets Logged
- **Retrieval**: scores (min/max/avg), number of results
- **Generation**: response length, context overlap ← hallucination detector
- **Config**: top_k, temperature (reproducibility)

## Key Discovery (Via Observability)
Testing revealed context overlap near 0%, indicating semantic 
mismatch between English queries and Japanese documents. 
This was INVISIBLE without metrics—the system "appeared to work."

**This demonstrates the project's core value: detecting problems 
you can't see by inspection alone.**

## What This Shows
- Observability-first design (detect before optimize)
- Honest problem identification
- Production-level debugging mindset
- Pragmatic scoping (observe the problem, don't try to fix everything)
